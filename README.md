# Interactive Narrative Game

## Project Description

Video games as a medium are entirely built around interactivity. Unlike other types of media, the participant — or in this case, the player — actively engages with it, rather than passively consuming it. At the core of that interactivity lies the concept of choice. In video games, the player is not only a spectator but also a storyteller, free to choose the next course of action, as opposed to simply watching a linear storyline.

This project aims to create a choice-driven narrative game at a smaller scale. The game will feature at least two decision points where the player's choices will lead to different consequences.
